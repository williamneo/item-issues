This item has issues both with its name and also at the Petpet Puddle.

1. This item's name has bizarre characters at the end which should be removed and
2. This petpet cannot be painted at the Petpet Puddle because the original Vacumatic 9000 has not been assigned a base colour. It should likely be Red.
