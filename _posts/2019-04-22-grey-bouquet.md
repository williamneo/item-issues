excerpt: The Wishing Well (and possibly other dailies) gives out a broken version of Grey Bouquet.
---

When Grey Bouquet was fixed by Donny, its ID was changed and the one at the old ID (79653) was simply deactivated. However, it remains in the system with a rarity of 80, and thus the Wishing Well gives out the deactivated version with the old ID.

I recommend fixing this by changing the rarity of the deactivated version to 101 or higher.
