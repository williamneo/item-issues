title: Navigating This Site
categories: [blog]
---

Navigating this page is slightly different than navigating my petpage. Hopefully nothing here is too hard to find, but herein I explain things that may not be entirely obvious.

The "Jump to" nav at the top functions very similarly to the sidebar of my petpage. It shows (a limited subset of) tags -- different types of issues -- which contain posts. This is functionally equivalent to my sidebar, where I found myself routinely hiding links to issue types without any listed issues.

There are some pages/tags that are not linked up top of every page which can be found on the [sitemap][sitemap] linked in the navigation. A bonus feature of the sitemap is that the links to issue pages also display a count of how many individual posts there are with tags indicating that type of issue.

That's about it I think. There's not much to really say I guess -- at least not as much as I thought there would be when I sat down to type up this post! As with everything else here, if you think anything could be improved (which I'm _sure_ it can), [shoot me a Neomail][neomail] or open up an issue or pull request.
