I am attempting to migrate /~Keiynan over to Jekyll (where you are right now!). The reasons for this are many. Here are just a few:

1. Jekyll should be far easier to maintain, as it separates content and presentation. Additionally, I can develop locally without having to worry about the filters messing stuff up.
2. The filters on Neopets are sometimes annoying. I can talk about grapes freely here!
3. This site lives on GitHub. Everything is version controlled.
4. I just want to learn to use Jekyll better. :man_shrugging:

Due to the above reasons, this site is much easier to develop than my petpage. That said - this, like my petpage - is still a major work in progress. If you see anything funny or wrong, or just have suggestions, feel free to Neomail me. Or even better, open an issue or pull request on GitHub! :)
