This is a page where Will (Neopets user [minnesotan][userlookup]) keeps track of item issues they notice, or are asked to add.

This page is similar to Zav's page on [/~Ereza][ereza], but only for issues that do _not_ concern wearable assets. Neocash items are in scope here, but as most issues with those are with the assets, the issues here tend to be almost all Neopoint items.

If you know of any item issues you believe should be added here, please [Neomail me][neomail]!

**NOTE:** I cannot help you with bugs with items on your account (e.g., a capsule that won't open or a missing event prize). For issues with your account you must contact support by following the directions on [the help page][neo-help]. Do not Neomail me about these problems!
