title: Duplicated Names
permalink: /duplicated-names/
---

This page lists most known cases of duplicated item names (not listed: "acceptable" duplicates, e.g., map pieces or unreleased items). It is split into sections according to whether the items which share a name are both NC items, both NP items, or one of each. Habitarium items have their own section, but generally speaking these are not so problematic.

## Both Neopoint Items

{% include duplicates.html type='np' %}

## Both Neocash Items

{% include duplicates.html type='nc' %}

## One NP Item, One NC Item

{% include duplicates.html type='both' %}

## Habitarium?

{% include duplicates.html type='habitarium' %}
